### ‚úÖ Part 3 - Phonebook Backend

| Exercise | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 3.1 | Set up a basic Express server and created a `/api/persons` endpoint to return all phonebook entries as JSON. |

| 3.8 | Customized Morgan to log the request body for POST requests by defining a custom token. |
| 3.9 | Made the backend work seamlessly with the phonebook frontend by connecting API endpoints and ensuring proper data flow. |
| 3.10 | Deployed the backend to the internet, making the API accessible remotely. |
| 3.11 | Generated a production build of the frontend and served it from the backend, making the full application accessible as a single unit. [Live demo](https://the-phonebook-y2f0.onrender.com/) |
| 3.12 | Set up MongoDB connection with Mongoose, created a command-line interface for adding and viewing phonebook entries directly from the database. |
