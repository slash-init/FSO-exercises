# Phonebook App

This project is a full stack phonebook application with a React frontend and an Express backend. The backend provides a RESTful API for managing contacts, while the frontend offers a user-friendly interface to view, add, update, and delete entries.

- **Frontend:** Built with React, located in the `dist` folder after build.
- **Backend:** Built with Node.js and Express, handles all API requests and serves static frontend files.

Work is in progress and new features will be added.
